# Implementation-and-Evaluation-of-K-Means-Clustering-from-Scratch
This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using NumPy. It generates a synthetic dataset, applies custom clustering, and evaluates performance using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score. Final clusters and centroids are visualized using Matplotlib for clear interpretation.
