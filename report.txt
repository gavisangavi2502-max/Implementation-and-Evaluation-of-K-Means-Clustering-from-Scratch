K-Means Clustering Project – Full Analysis Report
-------------------------------------------------

1. Dataset
A synthetic 2D dataset with 4 true clusters was generated using sklearn.make_blobs.
The dataset contains 500 samples and is saved as synthetic_data.csv.

2. Implementation
A complete NumPy-only K-Means algorithm was developed:
• Random centroid initialization
• Cluster assignment using Euclidean distance
• Centroid update using mean of points
• Convergence check using tolerance
• Inertia (SSE) calculation

3. Elbow Method
The inertia was calculated for K=1 to K=9.
The elbow point clearly appears at K=4, confirming the true underlying structure.

4. Silhouette Analysis
Silhouette scores were computed for K=2 to K=9.
The highest silhouette score also appears at K=4, validating this choice.

5. Visualization
The following visualizations are included:
• elbow_plot.png (Elbow Curve)
• silhouette_plot.png (Silhouette Curve)
• final_clusters.png (Final cluster visualization with centroids)

6. Interpretation
The optimal K=4 aligns with both Elbow and Silhouette results.
The scratch implementation performs accurately, though slower than library versions due to manual loops and no vectorized optimizations.

Conclusion: All evaluation steps, visualizations, and analysis requirements have been met.
